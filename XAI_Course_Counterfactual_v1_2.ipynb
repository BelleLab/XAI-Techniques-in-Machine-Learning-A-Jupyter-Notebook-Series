        "\n",
        "There are many libraries which try to introduce counterfactuals in Python. Firstly, there is DiCE (Diverse Counterfactual Explanations) that you can find [here](https://https://github.com/interpretml/DiCE) which has been based on a research paper outlined in [this](https://https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/open-source-library-provides-explanation-for-machine-learning-through-diverse-counterfactuals/) blogpost. However, at the moment, it only works with selected TensorFlow/PyTorch models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Secondly, [CEML](https://ceml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) could be another choice. One limitation of it, though, is that it only allows you to explain a rather narrow array of models such as basic scikit-learn implementations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thirdly, we could also leverage the counterfactual methods contained inside the [Alibi](https://docs.seldon.io/projects/alibi/en/latest/) package. Unfortunately, the API is quite complex, focuses on neural networks and, in practice, can return awkward errors instead of desired outputs. Despite this, this is the most universal open source framework currently available and this notebook will show you how you can successfully apply it.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will utilise the technique within the context of stop and search practices employed by police officers in London. The exercises will look at the data provided by the Metropolitan Police and The City of London Police which can be accessed via the following [link](https://data.police.uk/data/).\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's assume in this tutorial that the police force wants to introduce robo-police who would patrol the streets and perform stop and search operations based on a classification model. This algorithm would assume that a good outcome is one where a stopped person ends up being fined or arressted and a bad outcome is a situation where no further action is taken. The idea here is to replicate decisions of human police using historical data.\n",

Use the XGBoost ```predict_proba``` function to identify the instances that are close to the decision boundary, where prediction for class 0 is 50-53%, and instances far from the decision boundary, where prediction for class 0 is greater than 83% or 90%. Create two sets of these model-confident and model-uncertain points and select a single instance from each set. For both cases, generate counterfactuals, then compare the counterfactual explanations for the confident instance and the uncertain instance. What features are the same if any, and what can be inferred between the two counterfactuals in terms of features and the confidence of the model? *Hint: As your model performance may be different, feel free to adjust the prediction accuracy threshold in order to identify confident and uncertain instances.*\n",

What can broadly be inferred based on the counterfactual explanations of these three instances?\n",

So for each plot on one of the features, simply set the```interaction_index``` to the opposite feature. Can those graphs help us explain counterfactuals driven by geoinformation?\n",
